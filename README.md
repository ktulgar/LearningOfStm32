# Adventure-Of-Learning-Of-Embedded-Programming

I want to perform real engineering.That's why i chose this area to work.But my school doesnt give course regarding embedded software.I will
learn everything about embedded world on my own.I chose stm32 discovery card to step into this field.I am newbie yet.I will display projects
that i did in learning process.Of course i started with led blink.I will increase the difficulties of projects with time.
