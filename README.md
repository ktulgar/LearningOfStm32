# Learning Of Stm32

I want to perform real software engineering.That's why i chose this area to work.But my school doesnt give course regarding embedded software.I will
learn everything about embedded software on my own.I chose stm32 discovery card to step into this field.I am newbie for now.I will display projects
that i did in process of learning. Of course i started with led blink.I will increase the difficulties of projects with time.
