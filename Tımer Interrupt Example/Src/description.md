I found this project on internet.It was given in a university as homework.And i wanted to do it for practice.I used user button and user leds Which are on discovery board.I push the button for a while.I have to calculate this period of time(as second).After calculation i will represent this period of time as binary using user leds.There are 4 user leds.That means period of time can be  15 seconds at most.After 15 it remains as 15.
I used timer interrupt to find this period of time.It approximately  gives correct second.

D12 = zeroth bit
D13 = first bit
D14 = second bit
D15 = third bit
